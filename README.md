# Structure-based Control to Reverse Cisplatin Resistance in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This repository contains all the scripts used in our analysis pipeline for the project of cisplatin resistance reversion in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). We have only excluded the OCSANA+ tool as it can be accessed from its website https://ocsana-plus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are a unique group of clinically aggressive breast cancers for which surgery and chemotherapy are the only available therapeutic modalities. Dr. Ed Liu and his lab, identified a genomic configuration called the tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) that defines a major subgroup of TNBC. TDP tumors are initially highly sensitive to cisplatin. Despite their initial responsiveness, they develop resistance to cisplatin therapy. The challenge addressed by the proposed project is to test and validate an analysis pipeline to identify therapeutic interventions to reverse cisplatin resistance in TNBC. The objective is to apply structure-based control approaches to identify network node overrides in the form of multiple gene interventions that have the effect of preventing the development of resistance.
